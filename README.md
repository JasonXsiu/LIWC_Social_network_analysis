# LIWC_Social_network_analysis
# What is this project about?
This analysis is to analyse the metadata and linguistic summary from a real on-line forum.

# Why you are doing it?
We want to see the activity, used language and social interactions in an social network like Tweeter.

# Description of the dataset
This dataset is of the metadata and linguistic analysis of posts over the years 2002 to 2011. The linguistic analysis was done using Linguistic Inquiry and Word  Count (LIWC), evaluating the prevalence of certain thoughts, feelings and motivations by calculating the proportion of key words used in communication.

# Process
1. Analyse activity and language on the forum over time
2. Analyse the language used by groups
3. Social network analysis (It is assumed that authors posting to the same thread at similar times, for example during the same month, as forming a social network. When these participants also post to other threads over the same period, their social network extends. )
4. Reflection on my investigation using the data science framework -- Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
